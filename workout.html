              Setting fitness goals is the first step toward a healthier, more active lifestyle. However, reaching those goals requires dedication, consistency, and the right approach to physical workouts
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Are you aiming to lose weight, build muscle, or improve overall fitness?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Start by defining your fitness objectives. Opt for a workout routine that aligns with your goals.For weight loss, focus on cardio and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). For muscle building, prioritize strength training and progressive overload. Set aside dedicated time slots for workouts and stick to them. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, combined with strength training exercises twice a week.</p>
              
              <p style="text-align: justify;">  
              Begin every workout with a proper warm-up to prepare your muscles and reduce the risk of injury. Keep a journal or use fitness apps to monitor your progress. Record details like workout duration, intensity, and any physical changes. If you’re unsure about techniques, consider hiring a personal trainer or joining a fitness class for guidance.</p>
              
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Physical workouts require proper fuel. Ensure your diet includes balanced portions of carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Stay hydrated before, during, and after workouts to maintain energy levels and support recovery.  Include rest days in your workout schedule to allow your body to recover and rebuild.</p>
              
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Your fitness journey may have ups and downs. Be ready to adjust your workout plan as needed to accommodate changes in your schedule, fitness level, or goals. Listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain or exhaustion.
